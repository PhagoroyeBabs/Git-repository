# Practical Exam: Hotel Operations

**LuxurStay Hotels** is a major, international chain of hotels. They offer hotels for both business and leisure travellers in major cities across the world. The chain prides themselves on the level of customer service that they offer. 

However, the management has been receiving complaints about slow room service in some hotel branches. As these complaints are impacting the customer satisfaction rates, it has become a serious issue. Recent data shows that customer satisfaction has dropped from the 4.5 rating that they expect. 

* This project identifies possible causes and hotel branches with the worst problems. 
* Clean the raw data, perform data transformation, and also;
* The difference in time taken to respond to a customer request in each hotel.
* Target improvements done in `Meal` and `Laundry` service in Europe (`EMEA`) and Latin America (`LATAM`).
